In the [SITraN group of Machine Learning](http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/sitran/) of the University of Sheffield we are organizing a series of meetups to bring together people interested in Data Science! The meetings typically consist on
presentations of relevant contributors to the Data Science field
combined with informal discussion, poster sessions, round tables etc. In
our first meeting we organized the first dynamic poster session using
IPython-notebooks! You can have a look at the IPython-notebooks
presented in the previous events [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/datascience/index.ipynb).

Feel free to join us! Actually, we are making up a mail list with
everyone interested in these events. Do not hesitate to contact
j.h.gonzalez@sheffield.ac.uk if you want to be part of it! Details about
future the events will be updated in this web.
