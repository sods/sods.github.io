[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org/) is a [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) European Research Infrastructure project that will run for four years, starting from September 2015. Two members of the ODSI, [Neil Lawrence](http://inverseprobability.com/) and [Mike Croucher](www.walkingrandomly.com) are involved with the project.

OpenDreamKit is a project that's open from beginning to end - even the grant proposal was written openly. Both [Mike](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5649)  and [Neil](http://inverseprobability.com/2015/01/14/open-collaborative-grant-writing/) have written about the unique experience of contributing to the proposal.
