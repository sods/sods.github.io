Today Neil took part in the [11th Round Table](http://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/network/policy-fellowship/460-adda13df9018f9fa566e5cc52300d867b8c5d6e5/) for the Centre for Science and Policy fellowship meeting at Trinity Hall, Cambridge on the future of work.

Neil's slides from his lunchtime talk [can be found here](http://inverseprobability.com/talks/lawrence:futureofwork16/2016/05/27/machine-learning-and-the-future-of-work.html), and his [contributor page here](http://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/network/neil-lawrence/).

The CSaP fellowship is a group of senior policy advisors who gather together regularly to discuss the interaction of science and policy.
