In mid-may Neil participated in a Round Table at the Guardian on the Internet of Things. Neil gave his perspectives [in this blog post](http://inverseprobability.com/2015/05/19/guardian-round-table/). The Guardian's report came out today. [There's a video and a write up linked on this page](http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/video/2015/jun/04/internet-of-everything-startup-economy).

The summary is that most people felt that the internet of things was going to be (in the end) about data.
