One of the central tenets of good research software engineering practice is to automate as much of your computational workflow as possible. Such automation can significantly speed-up the throughput of computational research as well lead to increased accuracy and ease of reproducibility.

Raphaël Démolis, a researcher at Sheffield's Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, has been working on such an automated workflow using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, the commercial finite element analysis package, [Abaqus](http://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/), and the University High Performance Computing system, [iceberg](https://www.shef.ac.uk/wrgrid/iceberg). With a little help from Research Software Engineer, Mike Croucher, Raphaël recently managed to automate his entire workflow (see testimonial at [http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?page_id=5122](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?page_id=5122) for details)

The key software technologies used were the Python modules [Paramiko](http://www.paramiko.org/) and [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) and Mike will be writing up an example of how to use them with Sheffield's High Performance Computing system soon.
