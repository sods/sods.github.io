It's the first day of term today, so welcome to all our new undergraduate students this year.

This year we will aim to integrate our undergraduates better with or Open Data `Science Meetups. With this in mind we are launching a series of monthly meetings to be held at ["The Hide"](https://www.facebook.com/TheHideS3) in Sheffield.

First meeting is on 29th September at 4pm.
