Today Neil, [Mike](http://www.michaeltsmith.org.uk/) and [Andreas](http://staffwww.dcs.sheffield.ac.uk/people/A.Damianou/) will be flying to Kenya to help in delivering a Data Science School with former group member [Ciira wa Maina](http://dkut.ac.ke/electrical-and-electronic-engineering-department/dr-ciira-wa-mainas-profile/) and [John Quinn](http://air.ug/~jquinn/) (who holds a visiting position in Sheffield).

If we have time we'll try and provide updates on the progress of the school on [Neil's blog](http://inverseprobability.com). For the moment [here are some details](http://inverseprobability.com/2015/06/12/data-science-school-kenya/) behind the philosophy of the school.

You can find more [details of the school here](http://gpss.cc/dss15/) and the program for the [Workshop on Data Science in Africa](http://gpss.cc/dsa15/) as well.
