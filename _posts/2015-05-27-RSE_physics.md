Mike Croucher recently gave a talk to Sheffield's theoretical physics department to discuss what they can expect from a [Research Software Engineering](http://www.rse.ac.uk/who.html) service.

[The slides](http://mikecroucher.github.io/Physics_RSETalk_2015/#/) were produced using [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) which allows them to be version controlled, easily shared and viewed on any platform (even smartphones!) without the need to install additional software.
