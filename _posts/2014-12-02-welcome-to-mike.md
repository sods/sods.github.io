It's with great pleasure that we announce the appointment of [Mike Croucher](http://www.walkingrandomly.com) as the first recruit associated with the "Open Data Science Initiative". Mike is a leading international expert in research software engineering, and has been recruited across the Faculty of Engineering and central computing. Mike has been recruited as a research software evangelist.

Mike is extremely well respected for his blog on research software. He's given an update about the move [here](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5621).

Mike will join us from 2nd March.
