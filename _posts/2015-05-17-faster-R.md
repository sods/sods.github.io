One of the functions of the Research Software Engineering element of the Open Data Science Initiative is to work with researchers to improve their research code. Mike Croucher recently collaborated with Yered Pita-Juarez of Harvard University on some analysis code written in R. Mike helped reduce processing time from 2 hours per sample to 10 minutes per sample. For more details, read Yered's testimonial over at Mike's blog http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?page_id=5122.
