We have two main outlets for our software, in the [SheffieldML](https://github.com/SheffieldML/) github organisation we are mainly releasing new machine learning methodologies and in the [SODS](https://github.com/sods/) repository (software for open data science) we are releasing software targeted at making open data science easier for both 'generators' and 'consumers' of data science methodologies.
