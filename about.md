The Open Data Science Initiative aims to bring the philosophy of sharing
and community resource assimilation that underpins the success of the
open source software movement to the area of research software to
capitalise on underlying social driver that many talented people would
like to see their ideas and work being applied for the widest benefit
possible.

-   Make new analysis methodologies available as widely and rapidly as
    possible with as few conditions on their use as possible.
-   Educate our commercial, scientific and medical partners in the use
    of these latest methodologies
-   Act to achieve a balance between data sharing for societal benefit
    and the right of an individual to own their data.
